# To compile the code, please:
1, Put the whole "AAVP_final" folder inside the openFrameworks folder ".../apps/myApps".
3, Make sure the "ofxMaxim" addon has been properly installed.
4, Go into the "AAVP_final" folder, use Xcode to open "AAVP_final.xcodeproj".
5, If the buggy Xcode gives an empty window after compilation, nudge the window to activate it.
